## About Encentivize (and Workpoints in particular)
We're a small team, bent on making world class internet products. We don't see why we can't make killer software products in South Africa, that have universal appeal and market. Our flagship product, www.workpoints.co.za, is our play at software and solutions that makes staff rewards, recognition and engagement simple and available to everyone. We go to great lengths to make our solutions effortless to setup up and simple to use, and our goal is to change and enhance the relation of employees and their peers and their companies. 
 
As for our engineering side, we are not tied to any particular technology or system. We believe in giving developers as much autonomy as possible, and use as little decorative process as possible. Developers handle everything from dev to production deployment. We run on our own terms, and your input to the direction of the products is as important as your technical skill. 
 
We are exploring the world of microservices and scalable architecture. At the moment, our main technologies are mongo, node and angular, running on Azure, but we are always on the lookout for the best tools for the job.
